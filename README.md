# HRT_task3

Hi HRT,

I ran a little short on time on the third task but wanted to finish here. The HRT.py file will do at least most of what the task was requesting, to the best of my memory (unfortunately I did not copy it before time ran out).

I really enjoy doing work like this and am very thankful for the consideration. Thank you for your time and I look forward to learning more about the company.
